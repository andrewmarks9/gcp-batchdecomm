andrewmarks9: remove pii

GitHub Copilot: To remove Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from a shell script, you can follow these steps:

1. Identify common PII patterns such as email addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, etc.
2. Use regular expressions to find and replace these patterns with placeholders.

Here's a pseudocode plan:

1. Read the file content.
2. Define regular expressions for different types of PII.
3. Replace PII patterns with placeholders.
4. Write the sanitized content back to the file.

Now, let's implement this in a shell script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Define the input file and output file
input_file="gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh"
output_file="sanitized_gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh"

# Read the file content
content=$(cat "$input_file")

# Define regular expressions for PII
email_regex="[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}"
phone_regex="\b[0-9]{3}[-. ][0-9]{3}[-. ][0-9]{4}\b"
ssn_regex="\b[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{4}\b"

# Replace PII with placeholders
sanitized_content=$(echo "$content" | sed -E "s/$email_regex/[EMAIL]/g" | sed -E "s/$phone_regex/[PHONE]/g" | sed -E "s/$ssn_regex/[SSN]/g")

# Write the sanitized content to the output file
echo "$sanitized_content" > "$output_file"

echo "PII has been removed and the sanitized file is saved as $output_file"
```

This script will replace email addresses, phone numbers, and social security numbers with placeholders `[EMAIL]`, `[PHONE]`, and `[SSN]` respectively. Adjust the regular expressions as needed for other types of PII.

Ensure that these libraries are correctly installed and the paths are accurate.

Here's a step-by-step guide to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **Install Bats and its libraries:**

```sh
# Install Bats
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core.git
cd bats-core
sudo ./install.sh /usr/local

# Install Bats support libraries
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support.git
git clone https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert.git
```

2. **Move the libraries to the specified directory:**

```sh
mkdir -p /home/amarks/install
mv bats-support /home/amarks/install/
mv bats-assert /home/amarks/install/
```

3. **Update your test script to correctly reference the libraries:**

Ensure that the paths to [`bats-support`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bats-support%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") and [`bats-assert`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bats-assert%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A2%2C%22character%22%3A9%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") are correct in your test script:

GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that the script `../gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh` could not be sourced. This could be due to several reasons, such as the file not existing at the specified path, or there being an error within the script itself.

Here are the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify the Path:**
   Ensure that the [`gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Fgcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh") script exists at the specified relative path (`../gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh`).

2. **Check for Errors in the Script:**
   Ensure that there are no syntax errors or issues within the [`gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Fgcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh") script itself.

3. **Absolute Path:**
   Try using the absolute path to the script to ensure that the path is correct.

4. **Permissions:**
   Ensure that the script has the appropriate permissions to be read and executed.

Here is an updated version of your test script with additional checks:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import bats testing framework
load '/home/amarks/install/bats-support/load.bash'
load '/home/amarks/install/bats-assert/load.bash'

# Check if the script exists and is readable
if [ ! -r "../gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh" ]; then
  echo "Error: ../gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh not found or not readable"
  exit 1
fi

# Source the script to test

  run get_iam_members
  assert_success
  assert [ -n "$owner" ]
  assert [ -n "$editor" ]
  assert [ -n "$custom" ]
}

@test "disable_api_keys disables all

  mock_command gcloud "echo 'key1\nkey2'"
  run disable_api_keys
  assert_success
  assert_output --partial "Disabling API key: key1"
  assert_output --partial "Disabling API key: key2"
}

@test "disable_service_accounts disables all service accounts" {
  mock_command gcloud "echo 'account1@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\naccount2@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'"
  run disable_service_accounts
  assert_success
  assert_output --partial "Disabling service account: account1@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

  run gcloud recommender recommendations mark-dismissed "${rec_id}" --etag="${etag}" --location=global --recommender=google.resourcemanager.projectUtilization.Recommender --organization="${orgid}"
  assert_success
}
```

After making these changes, run the tests again:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/bats --tap test_gcp_batchdecomm.sh
```

If the script still fails to source, check the contents of [`gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Fgcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh") for any errors or issues that might prevent it from being sourced correctly.

GitHub Copilot: The error indicates that the script [`gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Fgcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh") is trying to access a file named [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") which it cannot find. To resolve this, ensure that [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") is present in the correct directory or update the script to reference the correct path.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") Exists:**
   Make sure that [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") exists in the directory where the script expects it to be.

2. **Update the Script to Use the Correct Path:**
   If [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") is in a different directory, update the script to use the correct path.

3. **Create a Mock [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") for Testing:**
   If you are running tests, you can create a mock [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") in the test directory.

Here is an example of how you can create a mock [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") for testing:

1. **Create a Mock [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv"):**

```sh
echo "project1,project2,project3" > /home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/tests/PROJECT_LIST.csv
```

2. **Update the Script to Use the Correct Path:**

If the script expects [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") to be in the same directory as the script, ensure the file is there. If not, update the script to use the correct path. For example:

```shell
# gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh

# Assuming the script expects PROJECT_LIST.csv in the same directory
PROJECT_LIST_FILE="$(dirname "$0")/PROJECT_LIST.csv"

if [ ! -f "$PROJECT_LIST_FILE" ]; then
  echo "Error: $PROJECT_LIST_FILE not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Use $PROJECT_LIST_FILE in the script
```

3. **Update the Test Script to Ensure the Mock File is Used:**

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import bats testing framework
load '/home/amarks/install/bats-support/load.bash'
load '/home/amarks/install/bats-assert/load.bash'

# Create a mock PROJECT_LIST.csv for testing
setup() {
  echo "project1,project2,project3" > /home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/tests/PROJECT_LIST.csv
}

# Remove the mock PROJECT_LIST.csv after testing
teardown() {
  rm -f /home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/tests/PROJECT_LIST.csv
}

# Source the script to test
source /home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/gcp-batchdecomm_10122023.sh

  run get_iam_members
  assert_success
  assert [ -n "$owner" ]
  assert [ -n "$editor" ]
  assert [ -n "$custom" ]
}

@test "disable_api_keys disables all

  mock_command gcloud "echo 'key1\nkey2'"
  run disable_api_keys
  assert_success
  assert_output --partial "Disabling API key: key1"
  assert_output --partial "Disabling API key: key2"
}

@test "disable_service_accounts disables all service accounts" {
  mock_command gcloud "echo 'account1@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com\naccount2@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com'"
  run disable_service_accounts
  assert_success
  assert_output --partial "Disabling service account: account1@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
  assert_output --partial "Disabling service account: account2@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
}

@test "save_project_iam saves and uploads IAM policy" {
  mock_command gsutil "echo 'File uploaded'"
  run save_project_iam
  assert_success
  assert_output --partial "File uploaded"
}

@test "dismiss_recommendation dismisses existing recommendation" {
  rec_id="test_rec_id"
  etag="test_etag"
  run gcloud recommender recommendations mark-dismissed "${rec_id}" --etag="${etag}" --location=global --recommender=google.resourcemanager.projectUtilization.Recommender --organization="${orgid}"
  assert_success
}
```

4. **Run the Tests:**

```sh
/usr/local/bin/bats --tap test_gcp_batchdecomm.sh
```

This should resolve the issue with the [`PROJECT_LIST.csv`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2FPROJECT_LIST.csv%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/home/amarks/portfolio_script/gcp-batchdecomm/PROJECT_LIST.csv") file not being found. Make sure the paths and file locations are correct relative to where the script and tests are being executed.

GitHub Copilot: The error message indicates that the `gcloud` command is trying to use a beta component that is not installed. To resolve this, you need to install the required `gcloud` components.

Here are the steps to install the necessary `gcloud` components and ensure your script runs correctly:

1. **Install the `beta` Component:**

```sh
gcloud components install beta
```

2. **Verify the Installation:**

Ensure that the `beta` component is installed correctly by running:

```sh
gcloud beta --help
```

3. **Update the Test Script:**

Ensure that the test script correctly mocks the `gcloud` commands if needed. Here is an updated version of your test script with additional checks:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import bats testing framework
load '/home/amarks/install/bats-support/load.bash'

This script ensures that:

1. The required [`gcloud`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gcloud%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") components are installed.
2. A mock `PROJECT_LIST.csv` file is created for testing and removed afterward.
3. External commands are properly mocked to avoid actual changes during testing.
4. The script handles potential issues gracefully and provides meaningful assertions.

Workspace: The provided script is a test suite written in Bash using the Bats (Bash Automated Testing System) framework. This script is designed to test various functions of a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) decommissioning script ([`gcp-batchdecomm.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gcp-batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition")). The Bats framework is loaded at the beginning of the script using the [`load`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22load%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") command to include support and assertion libraries.

The script sources the [`gcp-batchdecomm.sh`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gcp-batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") file, which contains the functions to be tested. Each test case is defined using the `@test` keyword followed by a description of the test. Inside each test block, the [`run`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22run%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A2%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") command executes the function being tested, and various assertions are made to verify the expected outcomes.

The first test, `"move_project moves project to destination folder"`, checks if the [`move_project`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22move_project%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A9%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function successfully moves a project to a specified destination folder. It asserts that the function runs successfully and that the output contains a specific message indicating the project has been moved.

The second test, `"get_iam_members retrieves owner, editor and custom role members"`, verifies that the [`get_iam_members`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22get_iam_members%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function retrieves the IAM members with owner, editor, and custom roles. It asserts the function's success and checks that the variables `$owner`, `$editor`, and `$custom` are not empty.

The third test, `"disable_api_keys disables all API keys"`, mocks the [`gcloud`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gcloud%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") command to simulate the presence of API keys and tests the [`disable_api_keys`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22disable_api_keys%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A23%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function. It asserts that the function runs successfully and that the output contains messages indicating the API keys are being disabled.

The fourth test, `"disable_service_accounts disables all service accounts"`, similarly mocks the [`gcloud`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gcloud%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A24%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") command to simulate service accounts and tests the [`disable_service_accounts`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22disable_service_accounts%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function. It asserts the function's success and checks that the output contains messages indicating the service accounts are being disabled.

The fifth test, `"save_project_iam saves and uploads IAM policy"`, mocks the [`gsutil`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22gsutil%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A40%2C%22character%22%3A15%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") command to simulate file upload and tests the [`save_project_iam`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22save_project_iam%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A39%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function. It asserts the function's success and verifies that the output contains a message indicating the file has been uploaded.

The final test, `"process_project performs all decommissioning steps"`, verifies that the [`process_project`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22process_project%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fhome%2Famarks%2Fportfolio_script%2Fgcp-batchdecomm%2Ftests%2Ftest_gcp_batchdecomm.sh%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A53%2C%22character%22%3A7%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") function performs all the necessary decommissioning steps. It asserts the function's success and checks that the output contains messages indicating each step of the decommissioning process has been completed.

Overall, this test suite ensures that the GCP decommissioning script functions correctly by verifying the expected behavior of each function through a series of well-defined test cases.

# GCP Batch Decommissioning Script

This repository contains a Bash script for decommissioning Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects in batch. The script performs various tasks such as moving projects to a destination folder, disabling API keys, disabling service accounts, saving IAM policies, and dismissing recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` and `gsutil` commands)
- Bats (Bash Automated Testing System) for running tests

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcp-batchdecomm.git
   cd gcp-batchdecomm
   ```

2. **Install Bats:**

   Follow the instructions on the [Bats GitHub page](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to install Bats.

3. **Configure Google Cloud SDK:**

   Ensure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured. You can download it from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Usage

1. **Prepare the project list:**

   Create a CSV file named `PROJECT_LIST.csv` containing the list of project IDs to be decommissioned.

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   ./gcp-batchdecomm.sh

# GCP Batch Decommissioning Script

This repository contains a Bash script for decommissioning Google Cloud Platform (GCP) projects in batch. The script performs tasks such as moving projects to a destination folder, disabling API keys, disabling service accounts, saving IAM policies, and dismissing recommendations.

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell
- Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` and `gsutil` commands)
- Bats (Bash Automated Testing System) for running tests

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gcp-batchdecomm.git
   cd gcp-batchdecomm
   ```

2. **Install Bats:**

   Follow the instructions on the [Bats GitHub page](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to install Bats.

3. **Configure Google Cloud SDK:**

   Ensure you have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured. You can download it from [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

## Usage

1. **Prepare the project list:**

   Create a CSV file named `PROJECT_LIST.csv` containing the list of project IDs to be decommissioned.

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   ./gcp-batchdecomm.sh
   ```

   The script will read the project IDs from `PROJECT_LIST.csv` and perform the decommissioning steps for each project.
